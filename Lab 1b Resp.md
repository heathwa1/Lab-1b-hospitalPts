I decided to look at the 'difference' function of Turf js. This looks to be like the 'clip' method in ArcMap where there is an input, clip feature, and output. However, in turf the input and clip features can only be polygons. In ArcMap if input are polygons, clip features must be polygons;  if the input are lines, clip features can be lines or polygons; if input features are points, clip features can be points, lines or polygons. The Turf method seems to be easy to understand with the var 'output' = turf.difference(poly1, poly2) with poly1 being the input and poly two being the clip feature, but it really seems a little too simplified.
